# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of Project
AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in a Amazon review dataset for outdoor products.  PySpark will be used to perform ETL and the data will be loaded into pgAdmin tables.  Next, PySpark will be used to perform calculations and analysis to determine if there is bias or not.
